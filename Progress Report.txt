Things left to do on slideshow

Assumptions:
 * No more design changes
 * No responsive design
 * Works on all modern browsers
 * Works but doesn't necessarily look perfect on IE8

Things that are already done:
 * Slide page creatable in CQ
 * Slideshow page HTML complete in Dreamweaver
 * Slideshow page CSS/JS mostly done in Dreamweaver
 * Slide page logic complete in CQ
 * Slideshow page template in CQ
 * Slideshow page dialog in CQ
 * Move JS/CSS into CQ ClientLibs
 * Add L/R arrows over main slide image
 * Grey out navigation arrows when they are unclickable
 * Create thumbnails from slide images using Sean's servlet
 * Slideshow page component in CQ
 * Slideshow page logic in CQ

Things that remain to be done:
 
 * Final slide logic and HTML/CSS
 * Browser testing: Chrome/Mozilla/Safari/IE9+
 * Browser testing: IE8
 * OPTIONAL: Teaser component for linking to slideshows

Bugs:
 
 * New Arrows
 



Squashed Bugs:

 * Escape HTML in caption field
 * Internal Server Error if no slides under slideshow
 * Thumbnail opacity to 0.6
 * Titles in correct font
 * Clicking on non-active thumbnail makes that thumbnail active and changes the slide.
 * First slide arrow centering
